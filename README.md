 In our repository you will find different type of file, each format has a specific role:
1. main.ipynb : the main file where we reported the entire homework
2. rq_i.py i from 1 to 3, where we stored the function used in first 3 requests
3. RQ_i.ipynb i from 4 to 7, requests without bash method 
4. RQ_i.sh sh files to implement bash method 
5. requirements.txt libraries needed to launch the code
